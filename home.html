        Question:
    </h2>
    <p>
How does biodiversity loss lead to an impact in humans economic and social life?
    </p>
        <p>
            Ever since about a 10 thousand years back, we raided land in order to create settlements but unconsciously we had modified other animals and plants we shape their surrounding and took over them! What was theirs before became ours, yet our mind is still unconscious about this we took what we needed and left the trash with them and the humans is so focused on getting what they want they forget about the consequences it may just sound like its hurting them and not us, well that's all not true we all have the right to live on the earth we all we send here for a specific reason.
Humans think they are smart by taking over land but they don’t know what's coming back to haunt them. This response is to show what will happen to us in the following years to come. Throughout this website, you will understand the key impacts of Biodiversity.

            Literature Review:
        </h1>
        <h2>
            Existing Research- 
        </h2>
        <p>
            On the internet, you can find information about biodiversity loss and its simple effects like how it affects animals in a negative way, like them not having a place to live and stay which forces them to come into the city and enter our houses and 92.2 billion die! We don’t realize all insects and animals are trapped as they can’t live outdoors cause we shaped their surroundings, which forced them to enter our houses, and if they did so they would die. I simply don’t understand why can’t they live in peace and us too. Let all of us have our own space to live and do our simple duties. We have one good source of animals killed in the U.S.A. this is named the 2024 U.S. ANIMAL KILL CLOCK the number is increasing, 27,098,026,476 (reported at Jun 27 2024 9:44 am) animals have been killed for food this year in the United States. The number increases on an average of 3,000 a second! Keep in mind, this is just the United States. “The time will come when men such as I will look upon the murder of animals as they now look upon the murder of men.”
-Dmitry Merezhkovsky, The Romance of Leonardo da Vinci, 1900

This is all the existing information and findings of biodiversity loss.

        <h2>
            Gaps in Knowledge:
        </h2>
        <p>
            We may have access to a lot of stuff but to mention not all some information may have never been discovered or looked at, like how much percent of biodiversity loss is caused by political reasons or some may be in progress like the number of animals who died this year as the topic on ‘Existing Research’ only talks about the United States but not the whole world, maybe it's in progress, all countries will come together and create a technology to show everyone in the world how we are destroying Mother Earth and its numbers. This event will influence people to stop killing animals and so on So, these are some examples of ‘Gaps in Knowledge’. We as researchers should investigate and fill the gaps try our best to get as much as information as possible. Connect it like dots to try get the missing piece, the one that completes the puzzle!
