                        <div class="des">Biodiversity has a major role in water resources. Firstly, water purification there are several natural purification systems some known as wetlands, forests, and grasslands they all act as if they are purifiers. Research shows that plants and soil organisms break down harmful substances leading to increasing water quality. Ecosystems help keeping the water cycle intact they include vegetation and forest that increases rainfall. Ecosystems also have the benefit of flood control allowing wetlands to absorb excess water. There is so much more to this like ‘Soil Stabilization’ prevents ‘Waterborne Diseases’ and also decreasing ‘Sanitation Issues’ all of this isn’t even one-fourth of the benefits of biodiversity in water resources.</div>

Biodiversity is simply essential to our physical, mental, and spiritual health. It may not be simple to understand but biodiversity has an amazing impact on our health and so much more it helps us maintain a high social standard.</div>

First being ‘Carbon Sequestration’ this is when forest absorb CO2 (Carbon Dioxide) and store it this reduces greenhouse gasses which further on reduces climate change. Wetlands store carbon therefore reducing climate change’s effects. Evaporation is when water vapor is released at most cases. Plants releases water vapor (Evaporation) into the atmosphere which tends to cool it!</div>

To put it in short in the next several years food will be much more vulnerable and more expensive, after some time many may not be able to afford simple food which is essential for a diet. This also links to SDG Goal 2 Zero Hunger. With animals, plants as well as trees all going extinct we will soon lose food.</div>
